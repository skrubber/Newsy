Buyers trying to exit the market claim there are no takers for their flats even if they are ready to take cuts and sell at prices lower than purchase points.?I bought my flat at Rs 71 lakh at Amrapali Zodiac in 2012 at the rate of Rs 4600psf. I want to sell my flat immediately, but the current offer in the market is not more than Rs 3200 psf, so the effective market price of my flat at the moment is Rs 50 lakh. I still want to sell this flat, because even by making a financial loss by selling this flat, I will be benefitting as I want to use this fund for buying another property,? Joginder Singh, buyer at Amrapali Zodiac, said.Similarly, at Panchsheel Greens, Noida Extension, Dipankar Kumar a buyer said that he had brought a flat at Rs 35 lakh in 2012 at the rate of Rs 2600 psf. He has put his property on sale and is presently only fetching a sale value of Rs 28 lakh for the same.?I want to wait for five years now to make at least marginal profits. I had bought the flat with the hope of the new metro lines, connectivity and other upcoming infrastructure development in the city, but those did not convert into property price hikes; so for people like me, it is now a waiting game. I don?t want to sell at 28 lakh, what I bought for 35 lakh. I will wait until prices rise to 40 lakh,? Kumar added.Noida and Greater Noida presently host a secondary market inventory of 35,000-40,000 apartments. The same number of apartments are also held as unsold inventory in the primary market. ?Resale Flats,? a real estate agent based out of Sector 18, Noida which only deals in properties up for resale, confirms that even if the apartments which are in select societies which have good track record of completion are still getting a high return, the ones which are mired in conflict, or projects are selling at even lower prices.?The falling prices of the secondary market revealed by the real estate companies show that the prices in Q4-2014, Q4-2015 stood at 4400psf and has been steadily tanking since then. Q42016 marked the secondary real estate prices at 4,350psf, Q4 2017 marked the average secondary real estate price-point reduce further to 4,320psf. JLL projects a marginal appreciation in the estimated secondary market prices in Q42018 at Rs4350psf,? explained Siva Krishan, Managing Director, Developer Solutions, JLL, Mumbai.Picking up from market corrections due to Real Estate Regulatory Act (RERA) and Goods and Sales Tax (GST), the market slowdown which has affected the primary market leading to a big inventory pile up has led to more aggressive correction in the secondary market which has resulted in a lot of customers willing to sell their flats yet holding on to their inventory.?The market situation is temporary, but we expect a turn around.
